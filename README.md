# SentimentAnalysis
Applying sentiment analysis on Reviews on a balanced and unbalanced dataset.
Refer to the Org_notbal.ipynb for unbalanced dataset and Org_balanced.ipynb for the balanced dataset

# Methodology & Techniques 
1. Data collection: Collecting data from various sources, such as online reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback.

2. Data balancing: Balancing the data if there is a class imbalance issue, meaning that one sentiment class may have significantly fewer samples than another. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and data augmentation can be used to address this issue.

3. Data preprocessing: Preprocessing the collected data by removing irrelevant data, correcting grammatical errors, and removing stopwords. Additionally, this step can involve data cleaning, such as removing duplicate reviews and handling missing data.

4. Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the preprocessed data, such as word frequencies, n-grams, and sentiment scores. This step can also involve feature engineering, such as creating features based on keywords related to tourism and travel.

5. Algorithm selection: Selecting a set of machine learning algorithms to compare for sentiment classification, such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
